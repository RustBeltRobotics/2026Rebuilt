- Update firmware on Radio to latest
    - Done
- Flash Rio if necessary
    - Done
- Implement ramp detection to set flag for ramp encountered (use tilt from gyro)
    - If ramp was encountered and tilt goes back to flat, set a separate flag to indicate vision odometry should be boosted (or just use resetPose)
        - After that is done, clear all flags
    - Done => needs to be tested to verify
- Implement LED control
    - Done (ish) => needs testing and likely tweaks to how we plan to actually use it    
- Update photonvision on Orange Pis to 2026.2.1 (using offline installer method)
    - installer jar is in C:\frc\2026\photonvision\offline-updates
- Get robot to camera translation values from CAD / physical measurement once placed on robot
- Generate CTRE swerve code
- Run Swerve SysId routines, import logs and update PID gains in constants
- Test basic field oriented drive
- Run robot at full speed with AdvantageScope open to get measured max velocity in M/S
    - Update MAX_VELOCITY_METERS_PER_SECOND and config in PathPlanner GUI to this value
- Implement a low RPM idle command for the shooter and set it as the default command for that system
- Run Shooter SysId routines, import logs and update PID gains in constants
- Define and test algorithm to auto-aim robot towards center of hub based on current robot pose and known hub pose
- Define and test algorithm to put shooter hood down automatically when approaching the trench (so we don't rip it off)
- Implement and test robot simulation using CTRE swerve and photonvision support
