TODO:
- Add output current logging to NT for Rev devices
- Add SmartCurrentLimit values to all Rev devices
- Implement position control on hood using relative encoder
    - Convert relative encoder position output to degrees
        - (position / 108.0 (gear reduction)) * 360 : this is sort of done, need verification on gear ratio from Dillan
    - Run SysId and geet FF/PID values
- Update photonvision on Orange Pis to 2026.2.1 (using offline installer method)
    - installer jar is in C:\frc\2026\photonvision\offline-updates
- Run robot at full speed forward in a straight linewith AdvantageScope open to get measured max velocity in M/S
    - Plot DriveState/Speeds/vxMetersPerSecond
    - Update MAX_VELOCITY_METERS_PER_SECOND and config in PathPlanner GUI to this value
        - https://pathplanner.dev/robot-config.html#-ntfiad_50
- Test / update CTRE Swerve constants kSlipCurrent
    - https://docs.advantagekit.org/getting-started/template-projects/talonfx-swerve-template/#slip-current-measurement
--------
Implemented, needs testing:
- Implement ramp detection to set flag for ramp encountered (use tilt from gyro)
    - If ramp was encountered and tilt goes back to flat, set a separate flag to indicate vision odometry should be boosted (or just use resetPose)
        - After that is done, clear all flags
    - Done => needs to be tested to verify
- Implement LED control
    - Done (ish) => needs testing and likely tweaks to how we plan to actually use it    

- Get robot to camera translation values from CAD / physical measurement once placed on robot
- Run Swerve SysId routines, import logs and update PID gains in constants

- Re-run Shooter SysId routines, import logs and update PID gains in constants (with vortex motors out of the loop)
- Re-run Feeder SysId routines, import logs and update PID gains in constants
- Run Hood SysId routines, import logs and update PID gains in constants
- Define and test algorithm to auto-aim robot towards center of hub based on current robot pose and known hub pose
- Define and test algorithm to put shooter hood down automatically when approaching the trench (so we don't rip it off)
- Implement and test robot simulation using CTRE swerve and photonvision support
