Core Feedforward Constants
 (Static Gain): Voltage to overcome static friction.
 (Velocity Gain): Voltage to maintain a specific velocity.
 (Acceleration Gain): Voltage to accelerate the mechanism.
 (Gravity Gain): Voltage required to counteract gravity (for arms/elevators). 

Method 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)
    This method involves applying increasing voltage and observing the motor's behavior to determine the constants.

1. Find Ks (Static Friction):
    a. Apply a very small voltage (e.g., 0.1V) to the motor and increase it slowly until the mechanism just begins to move.
    b. Do this in both directions and average the voltages.
    c. The voltage required to initiate movement is your Ks (in Volts).

2. Find Kv (Velocity Constant):
    a. Run the motor at a constant velocity (e.g., a known RPM or native units).
    b. Measure the voltage required to maintain that steady speed.
    c. Calculate Kv = (Voltage - Ks) / Velocity.
    d. A good starting point is 12V / Motor Free Speed (in Units / s).

3. Find Ka (Acceleration Constant):
    a. Ka is generally harder to measure manually.
    b. Alternatively, you can estimate it or, if the motor is not accelerating very fast, leave it at a low value or zero, relying on PID to pick up the slack.

4. Find Kg (Gravity Gain - Arms/Elevators):
    a. For Arms: Move the arm to the horizontal position. Apply voltage until it holds that position. Kg is the voltage needed to hold it there, which is Vholding * cos(angle).
    b. For Elevators: Apply voltage to hold it steady. Kg is simply that voltage.
